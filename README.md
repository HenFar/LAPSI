# LAPSI

## Intoduction
This repository goes over the final project conducted as part of the 2024/2025 LAPSI (Laboratorio Avan√ßado de Processamento de 
Sinal e Imagem) course. The project consisted of finding a paper of interest around the concepts discussed in class, selecting 
it, studying it, then reproducing its results and expanding upon them.

## The paper
The paper under study here, and that has also been added in the present repository, has the title "Detection of Ventricular 
Fibrillation Using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition of ECG Signals" and goes over the application of EMD (Empirical Mode
Decomposition) and EEMD (Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition) to decompose ECG (Elecrocardiogram) signals into their component
IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Functions), in an effort to identify patterns of either NSR (Normal Sinus Rhythm) or VF (Ventricular 
Fibrillation), that may lead to the discovery of early onset heart attacks and their early treatment, before major symptoms appear.
